#  Control of a firefighter robot using a Bluetooth HC-05
***
In this project, we realized an autonomous four-wheeled mobile robot, controllable 
automatically by a Bluetooth HC-05. Its role is to navigate a burning environment to
put out any fires that may be in its way.

### General Info
***
Robotics-based solutions are already highly valued for tackling global challenges in a
innovative and sustainable way, in order to preserve human life and the environment.
Having ourselves as much as the group has been interested from the start in eco-responsible solutions and
innovative, we wanted to work on a firefighting robot whose objective is to keep humans away from
risk of flames and smoke from fires.
In this project, we realized an autonomous, controllable four-wheeled mobile robot.
automatically by a Bluetooth HC-05. Its role is to navigate in a burning environment in order to
to extinguish any fires that may be in its path.
